# AppImage Installation Scripts

## What is this about

These scripts install an AppImage by decompressing it and integrating it to the system. These scripts can work with AppImages and SQUASHFS compressed AppDirs

## Hear me out

Installing AppImages by decompressing them goes against what AppImages are supposed to be used, yes, but this is not a disadvantage on systems that are ran from compressed media, such as live systems

Look at the following pictures, the size comparisons in each Terminal

Comparing the disk space occupied by SQUASHFS filesystems

Comparing the disk space occupied by bundled AppImages

The SQUASHFS compressed filesystem with bundled appimages is heavy, because AppImages are files that are already compressed

The SQUASHFS compressed filesystem with decompressed AppImages (the one with the date in the filename) is lighter, in this case even with 4 times more real space usage, because MKSQUASHFS is taking care of the compression of the entire filesystem including the applications that are provided as AppImages
